# Canadacoronavirus.R
I was analyzing Coronavirus that was in Canada. I got the data set from kaggle and I used R to analyze the data set. The variables that I focused on the most were the confirmed, death, and test variables. I had one graph showing the number of confirmed cases, another line graph showing the number of deaths, and a third line graph showing the number of people who got tested. I also decided to find the average of the number of confirmed cases, tests, and deaths. I also made one graph where I compared the number of confirmed cases in two provinces and I made another graph comparing the number of deaths in two provinces.
